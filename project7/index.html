                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used
                    to make webpages interactive
                    (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.).
                    There are also more advanced server side versions of JavaScript such as
                    Node.
                </p>

                <p>
                  
JavaScript and Java are completely different languages, both in concept and design.
JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997.
ECMA-262 is the official name of the standard. ECMAScript is the official name of the language.

                    <li>Client-side: It supplies objects to control a browser and its Document
                         Object Model (DOM). Like if client-side extensions allow an application to
                          place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
                           clicks, form input, and page navigation. Useful libraries
                         for the client side are AngularJS, ReactJS, VueJS, and so many others.

                    Server-side: It supplies objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server.
                   For if the server-side extensions allow an application to communicate
                    with a database, and provide continuity of information from one invocation
                     to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
                  The useful framework which is the most famous these days is node.js.

                To get started with writing Javascript,open the Scratchpad
                and write your first "Hello World" JavaScript code.
                <code>
                    function greetMe (yourName){alert("Hello"+yourName);}
                    greetMe("world");

                Java is a class-based object-oriented simple programming language. 
                Though we can not consider it to be fully object-oriented as it 
                supports primitive datatypes. It is a general-purpose, high-level 
                programming language that helps programmers
                 and developers to write a code once and run it anywhere.
